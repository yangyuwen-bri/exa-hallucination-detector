      For your analysis, consider all the sources collectively.

      Here are the sources:

      Here is the Original part of the text: ${original_text}

      Here is the claim: ${claim}

      Provide your answer as a JSON object with the following structure:

      claim: "...",
      assessment: "True" or "False" or "Insufficient Information",
      summary: "Why is this claim correct and if it isn't correct, then what's correct. In a single line.",

      confidence_score: a percentage number between 0 and 100 (100 means fully confident that the decision you have made is correct, 0 means you are completely unsure),
